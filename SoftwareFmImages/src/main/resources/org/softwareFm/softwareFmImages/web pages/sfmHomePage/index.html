				<h3>About us</h3>
				<img src="images/circle-diagram.gif" class="circles" alt="Diagram" />
				<p>In this age of on-line social interaction, SoftwareFM also provides insight into what software projects your friends are interacting with and, with your permission allows them to see which projects you are using.</p>
				<p>As a crowd sourced database, the more you use and contribute the more useful SoftwareFM will become.</p>

				<h3>Business Model</h3>
				<p>SoftwareFM is in its infancy and we are committed that the core Eclipse Plug-in will remains a free to use service for individuals. We do, however, have to generate enough cash to cover hosting fees and a handful of developers. We don't like the usual model of advertisements as they are too intrusive and waste valuable screen space.</p>
				<img src="images/globe1.jpg" width="155" height="168" alt="Globe" class="globe" />
				<p>Sometimes you want to find Individuals looking to sell their skills, added value products, value added resellers Maintenance and Support providers etc and we think there should be a place for these companies to sell their wares.</p>
				<p>We will be introducing this area very soon and you make the choice to see them when you are interested. So our main income stream will be through a membership model. The added value services that will become available will be driven by the membership, ensuring that they are the right services.</p>
