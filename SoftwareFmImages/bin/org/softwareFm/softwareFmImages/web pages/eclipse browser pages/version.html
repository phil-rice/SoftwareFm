			<p>This is the area of SoftwareFM that holds data about the specific version of the artifact that the selected item in the current editor is defined in. As with all areas of SoftwareFM you can add your own comments and read any of the comments other developers have posted.</p>

			<p>This is a good area to quickly see if there are more resent versions of the Jar available and, as the volume of comments increases, find out any particular problems with a particular version.</p>

			<p>his currently just holds a collection of digests that point to this jar, and any comments that people want to make</p>
