    	<h3>Installing SoftwareFm</h3>
    	SoftwareFm is installed as an Eclipse plugin. <a href="installing.html">Click here for instructions</a>. The update site is http://www.softwarefm.com/update. The plugin has been verified against the Indigo release.
    
	    <h3>The SoftwareFM view</h3>
	    Accessible with the Menu Window/Show View/Other then SoftwareFm/Explorer or Ctrl-3 and start typing "softwarefm".
	    
	    <h3>When working in an editor</h3>
	    SoftwareFM shows a summary of the information available for the software project that sourced the item you have selected. The right hand side shows a selection of the referenced materials. 
	    For example if there is are rss feeds, or tweets for this, then the "radio station" will show you a random page from them. This is work in progress, but the vision of the radio station
	    is to provide information that is important or entertaining based on your programming habits.<br /><br />
