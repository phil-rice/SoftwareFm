				<h3>Welcome to SoftwareFM</h3>

				<img src="images/circle-diagram.gif" class="circles" alt="Diagram" />

				<p>Now that 2011 has passed and 2012 is now well and truly underway, we are pleased to announce the latest release of SoftwareFM is available for download.</p>

				<p>Please feel free to download a copy and start using it; and please let us have your feedback and any suggestions as to how it should evolve.</p>

				<p>We would like to extend a warm thank you to those developers that have already downloaded, interacted with, and given valuable feedback on the earlier releases. As a consequence of this feedback, we have significantly improved the workflow around adding new jars to the crowd sourced database, especially when that jar is "rt.jar"</p>

				<p>One of the new features available is the ability to store and view snippets.</p>

				<p>As with any crowd sourced database, it gets better as more people add to it. We therefore ask that you add as much as you can on the projects that you have experience in.</p>

				<p>Let us know what you would like, or even better get involved with the open source development of SoftwareFM.</p>

				<p>From everyone at SoftwareFM, we wish you a prosperous new year.</p>

				<div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>

				<h3>Road Map</h3>
				<p>Now that we have users that are downloading and trialing SoftwareFM, our primary development work will be dominated by monitoring the usage of SoftwareFM, identifying problems and bottlenecks, and fixing them. An example of this is the new workflow for adding Unrecognised Jars.</p>

				<p>In this age of on-line social interaction, we will, in subsequent releases, provide insight into what software projects your friends are interacting with and, with your permission allows them to see which projects you are using.</p>

				<p>The broadcasting of relevant news and information will be improved, allowing you to configure your own radio channels ensuring you are kept up to date with what is happening in the world, based on your current programming habits.</p>

				<p>Recruitment is another area where we feel SoftwareFM can really help people. So we are planning to open a recruitment centre where you, as an individual, can broker your skills and be able to demonstrate that you do have experience with specific software projects.</p>
