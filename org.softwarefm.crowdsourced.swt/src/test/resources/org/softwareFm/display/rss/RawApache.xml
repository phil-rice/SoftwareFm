			<title>Release of Apache Rivet, version 2.0.4</title>
			<description>
				<p>
					<a href="/projects/rivet.html">Apache Rivet</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Apache Rivet is a system for creating dynamic web content via the
					Tcl
					programming language integrated with Apache Web Server. It is
					designed to be fast, powerful and extensible, consume few system
					resources, be easy to learn, and to provide the user with a
					platform that can also be used for other programming tasks outside
					the web (GUI's, system administration tasks, text processing,
					database manipulation, XML, and so on). In order to meet these
					goals Tcl programming language was chosen to combine with the
					Apache HTTP Server.

			<title>Release of Apache Portable Runtime, version 0.9.20</title>
			<description>
				<p>
					<a href="/projects/portable_runtime.html">Apache Portable Runtime</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to
					create
					and maintain software libraries that provide a predictable
					and
					consistent interface to underlying platform-specific
					implementations. The primary goal is to provide an API to which
					software developers may code and be assured of predictable if not
					identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which their
					software is built, relieving them of the need to code special-case
					conditions to work around or take advantage of platform-specific
					deficiencies or features.
