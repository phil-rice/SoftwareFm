Known Issues:
* Better project take on workflow. 
** import via published maven pom
** Current crappy manual method specifying groupid/artifactid/version using wiki page is probably ok for now
** special handling of rt.jar / classes.jar
* Need a better naming convention for nested classes.
	For example should be package/parentClass/nestedClass, and has to work with nested/nested etc classes
* Anonymous classes are handled very poorly: package//method is not a good url


The build process sucks. Big time conflict between Maven and Eclipse
* You need to run "build.bat" which will:
** build / run tests / install the jars org.sofwarefm.utilities and org.softwarefm.eclipse into the maven repository
** copy the required jars from the maven repository to the lib folder of the org.softwarefm.software folder
** You need to modify the first line "set m2=c:\users\phil\.m2\repository" to point to your maven repository
** If you are a *nix user, then the batch file needs to be turned into a script file. For example \s need changing to / and the "copy" to "cp", and the files persmissions need to be made executable
** I will try and improve this in the near future
