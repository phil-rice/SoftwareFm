		<div class="bodytext">
			<p>Within SoftwareFM's crowd sourced database, we store information about the Artifact that the selected item in the current editor is defined in</p>

			<p>This information consists of mailing lists, tutorials, documentation, rss feeds, forums etc.</p>

			<p>SoftwareFM also allows companies/individuals, who wish to make themselves commercially available to assist, in the context of the particular Jar, to advertise themselves in the sections about companies and adverts</p>

			<p>This is the most important part of the crowd sourced database as it is where we can all share with each other</p>
